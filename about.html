        <p>readium was founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to provide free access to knowledge and literature for everyone, regardless of their geographical location, financial status, or background. Our journey began with the belief that education and reading are fundamental human rights, and no one should be deprived of the opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
        <p>Driven by this vision, we set out to create a digital library that would house a vast collection of books spanning various genres, topics, and languages. Through partnerships with authors, publishers, and organizations dedicated to education, we curated a diverse selection of books, making them accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</p>
        <p>Over the years, readium has grown into a global community of readers, learners, and educators who share our passion for knowledge and discovery. We are committed to breaking down barriers to education and fostering a culture of lifelong learning.</p>
